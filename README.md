# Music Player Demo

This project demonstrates a music player app with background audio support and intuitive media controls. Whether you’re listening to short clips or long-form content like podcasts or music playlists, the app ensures seamless playback even when switching between apps. This demo also handles essential media controls for a frustration-free experience.

## Key Features

- **Background Playback**: Continue enjoying your audio content without interruption even when switching to other apps (e.g., switching to a fitness app while listening to a podcast).
- **Media Controls**: Easily control audio playback (play, pause, skip, etc.) directly from the notification bar, allowing you to pause or adjust audio quickly without navigating back to the app.
- **Notification Controls**: Control audio from the notification bar with play/pause, skip, and volume adjustment. This is essential for scenarios where you don’t want to interact with the app interface directly.
- **Intuitive User Interface (UI)**: Simple design for easy navigation and audio management, making it user-friendly.
- **Media Session Support**: Ensures that playback controls are accessible even when the app is in the background or the screen is locked.
